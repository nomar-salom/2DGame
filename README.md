Overview:
	Ruby Rose Garden is a 2D platformer where you play as a thief trying to steal rubies from a rose garden, and eventually reaching the giant ruby. 
 The main objective of the game is to make it to the end of the three levels, but to obtain a higher score it will be based on how fast you complete the level and how many rubies you collect. 
 There will be a couple of hazards that will be in the game. Those hazards will include stationary saws, moving saws, and pitfalls filled with water.
 If the player were to touch any of these objects, it is an instant kill and they start from the beginning of the level they are on. Players do not have a limited number of lives, but instead the timer will still continue which will hurt their score.

Changes:
	I had to change and compromise on a lot of the art assets for this game since I did not have the creativity/time to make my own assets as well as could not find free online assets. 
 I also got rid of the falling shovels obstacle since I felt like the moving trimmers achieved the same effect I was aiming for. For the Player controller, 
 I got most of my help creating all the movements from a tutorial I saw from the youtuber Tarodev. The movement felt amazing which is why I used this specific controller in my game. Though I used the controller, 
 I changed some of the movement parameters and changed the animations for the character. I also changed the camera movement so that instead of it being static, it instead would follow the player. 
 I did this for viewing sake as well as so the player would have to try and find the rubies on the map.
